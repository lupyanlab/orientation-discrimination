** Instructions on the use of these feature norms files **

The tab-delimited text files in this archive were exported from four Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. These spreadsheets contained multiple worksheets which were saved as separate text files. Instructions for reconstituting the worksheets in Excel follow the worksheet descriptions below.

* CONCS_brm [2 files]
Contains a number of concept-related statistics for each of the 541 concepts present in the norms.
The original file contained two worksheets: 
	CONCS_brm
	CONCS_brm_variable_explanations


* CONCS_FEATS_concstats_brm [2 files]
Lists the features given by at least 5 of 30 participants for each of the 541 concepts, and presents a number of related statistics. Note that some of these statistics are duplicated in other worksheets.
The original file contained two worksheets: 
	CONCS_FEATS_concstats_brm
	CONCS_FEATS_concstats_brm_variable_explanations

* FEATS_brm [2 Files]
Presents feature statistics for 2526 features listed by at least 5 of 30 participants.
The original file contained two worksheets: 
	FEATS_brm
	FEATS_brm_variable_explanations

* cos_matrix_brm_IFR [3 Files]
Presents the between-concept cosine matrix for the 541 concepts. Limitations within Excel on the number of columns available in a single worksheet required the matrix to be separated into three worksheets.
	cos_matrix_brm_IFR_1-200
	cos_matrix_brm_IFR_201-400
	cos_matrix_brm_IFR_401-541


** Reconstituting the Excel files **

If you wish to recreate the original Excel files, open the text files associated with each spreadsheet in Excel. For example, to recreate CONCS_brm, use Excel to open up the two associated text files: CONCS_brm.txt, and CONCS_brm_variable_explanations.txt.

There will be two active spreadsheets. Select one of the workbooks. In the menubar, find the Edit > Move or Copy Sheet... menu option. A pop-up dialog box will appear, which you can use to select the book to which the worksheet is copied. By default, the worksheet will be copied within its own book; to move the worksheet to the other book, select the other book from the dialog box. The other spreadsheet should now have both worksheets.
