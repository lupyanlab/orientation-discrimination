      Welcome to the MWP Experiment! Press the SPACEBAR to begin.

      Today your job is to identify which picture (left or right) is oriented
      correctly in the normal, upright position. For example, you might see the
      two pictures below. They are exactly the same image, except that one of
      them is flipped 180 degrees so that it is upside down, and the other is
      not flipped. Your job is to pick the one that is *not flipped*, and press
      the key for that picture. If the upright picture is on the left, you will
      press the left arrow. If it's on the right, press the right arrow. Press
      the correct key for the images below to continue.

      Before you see the pictures, you will hear a word through the headphones.
      Please put the headphones on now. Press the SPACEBAR to hear a word,
      and then you will see two new pictures. Respond to the pictures
      using the arrow keys.
  4:
    tag: word
    top: >
      Sometimes the word you hear will not match the pictures you see, but your
      task is exactly the same: determine which picture is correctly oriented.
      You need to pay attention to the word you hear because on some trials
      instead of seeing pictures you will see a word printed in one of the frames
      instead of pictures. On these trials, you should respond which word was
      the same as the one you heard through the headphones. If it's the same
      word, press the *up arrow*. If it's a different word, press the *down arrow*.
      Press the SPACEBAR to see one of these trials.
  5:
    main: >
      Please note that if you see a single word instead of two pictures, the
      location of the word doesn't matter, and therefore you can't respond
      using the left or right arrow keys. Remember to use the up and down
      arrow keys for these trials.


      If you accidentally press the left or right arrow keys on the word trials,
      nothing will happen. You must press the up or down arrow keys to continue.

      As you perform this task, please stare at the center of the screen
      directly at the "+" and respond based on what you see with your peripheral
      vision. On some trials you will see flashing colorful patterns as shown
      below. Keep looking at the "+" even when the patterns are flashing. You
      will now start with some practice trials. If you have any questions about
      the task, ask the experimenter now. When you are ready to begin, press the
      SPACEBAR.
practice: >
  You've completed the practice trials. Do you have any questions? If so, now
  is the time to ask the experimenter.


  The next trials will be harder because you will not receive any feedback on
  your performance. Please do your best to respond as quickly and accurately
  as possible.
test: >
  You've finished a part of the experiment. Take a break, but please stay in
  the room. When you are ready to continue, press the SPACEBAR.
timeout: >
  You ran out of time! Take a quick break if you need to. When you are ready to
  continue, press the SPACEBAR.
wrong_keys: >
  It looks like you used the wrong keys to respond. As a reminder:


  If you see pictures, use the left or right arrow to indicate which picture is
  upright.


  If you see a word, respond with the up arrow if the word is the same as the
  one you heard, or press the down arrow if it's a different word (regardless of
  which side it's on).


  Press the SPACEBAR to resume the experiment.
end: >
  You have finished the experiment. All that's left is a short survey. After
  you exit this screen by pressing the SPACEBAR, a survey should open in your
  browser window.
